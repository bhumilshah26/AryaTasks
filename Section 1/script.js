//Execution Context is something behind the scenes

// why any js is ran a special env is created 
// this involves the transformation and execution of code
//two contexts => global and function execution context

//thread of execution => single threaded language =>interpreter and executes line by line
//there are async capabilities

// memory creation phase(vars and fncs stored) and execution phase(thread)
// in memmory creation phase
// => creates global object(browser = 'window')
// => creates the 'this' to the object
// =>setup memory heap for storing variables and function references
// =>store fns and vars in global execution context and set to undefined(only vars is undefined fns' whole code is stored)



//Execution phase
// =>line by line execution
// =>create a new execution context for each function call
// =>values to these above stored vars is given when the code is executed


// =>path to (sources tab in web browser)
